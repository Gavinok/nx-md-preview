* nx-md-preview

** Status

Currently *nx-md-preview* is only just being developed so it's not 100%
there yet. See the Todo List for more information.

** Features

nx-md-preview supports

- Lists
- Code blocks
- Tables
- Auto refresh
- Inline HTML and more

** Example Output

Here is an example using my personal color scheme

[[file:res/screen-shot.png]]

* Install
Currently nx-md-preview depends on 2 external projects [[https://github.com/3b/3bmd][3bmd]] a Markdown
to HTML conversion library and [[https://github.com/Shinmera/file-notify][file-notify]] a file watcher. The 2nd I
intend to remove by 1.0.

** Quicklisp
Since there are external dependencies it's best to load this project
using Quicklisp.

#+begin_src 
git clone <this project> ~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions/
#+end_src

Then add ~(ql:quickload :nx-md-preview)~ to your ~~/.config/nyxt/init.el~

This will install the dependencies and allow you to access the
Markdown preview functionality.


** Usage

After loading simply run the command ~markdown-preview~ from within Nyxt
(accessed via the control+space)

*** Todo List 
- [ ] Create a custom mode
- [ ] Allow for user defined CSS
- [ ] Remove dependency on =file-notify=
- [ ] Make 3bmd optional for users who are fine with Spinneret
- [ ] Limit prompt results to either directories or markdown files
- [ ] Stop watching when buffer is killed
- [ ] Don't reset window hight on reload
- [ ] Tie the watcher thread to a new mode
- [ ] Determine why so many scans are happening
  - It literally says "Scan was called 678 times"!!!
